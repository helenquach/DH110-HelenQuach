# Greenforum: A Sustainability-Minded Community
## Helen Quach | DH 110 | Fall 2022

### Design Statement
The goal of this project is to design a website that provides people with the resources to learn about one of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, Goal #11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The website will feature a News page where users can easily access the latest relevant news regarding environmental sustainability. The website will also feature a social aspect on the Community page, where users can interact with one another in a forum and ask questions about living a sustainable lifestyle, read reviews of local businesses, and recommend tips for other members of the community. The website is called Greenforum (stylized "greenforum") to emphasize the intersection between community and sustainability.
