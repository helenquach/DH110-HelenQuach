# Assignment 05: Low-Fidelity Prototype
Helen Quach | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Project Description
This project aims to provide users with the resources to learn about one of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, Goal #11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The project will have a news page and a community page. The news page will present to the user recent news articles related to Goal #11, the environment, climate change, and sustainable living. The user will be able to share interesting news articles to their social media followers and spread the word about what they learned and want others to learn. On the community page, users will be able to create posts and tag them as Recommendations, Reviews, Questions, etc. The user can recommend tips on how to live sustainably, review local businesses or sustainable products, and ask questions to experts in the community. Users can comment on others' posts, like and dislike comments, and otherwise interact with others in the community.

#### User Research
The target users are young adults who are interested in sustainable living and passionate about the environment. From user research, I have determined that users want to feel reassured by other members in their community that their efforts towards sustainable living are making a difference. Users also want to be able to access relevant news easily and access information about local businesses before committing to supporting them. In addition, experienced users are constantly looking for new ways to live sustainably.

#### Personas + Usage Scenarios
I created two personas for two different usage scenarios:
* A young woman active on social media who is curious about sustainable living and wants to spread the word about climate change
* A young man who wants to share his experiences living sustainably with others in the community

#### Purpose of Low-Fidelity Prototype
The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping is to test the functionality and flow of the design before investing in a fully developed product. 

## Tasks
The low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks: 
1. The ability to read relevant news articles in a curated feed and share them on social media
2. The ability to read/write posts in a community forum about sustainable living where you can recommend products and write reviews on local businesses
