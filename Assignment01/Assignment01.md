# Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation

Helen Quach | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Tentative Title: Sustainable Cities

### About the project
I want to create a website that provides users with information on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal #11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The website will provide links to information regarding the various target goals related to Sustainable Cities and Communities, such as disaster risk reduction, sustainable transport, safe and affordable housing, and more. It will also provide resources to users wanting to learn more about the topic and methods of sharing information about the topic.

## About this evaluation
I will conduct a heuristic evaluation of two websites related to Sustainable Cities and Communities similar to the one I want to create. I will use [Nielson's 10 Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) and a [severity rating system](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/) from 0-3, as defined below.

### Nielson's 10 Heuristics
<ol>
  <li>Visibility of system status</li>
  <li>Match between system and the real world</li>
  <li>User control and freedom</li>
  <li>Consistency and standards</li>
  <li>Error prevention</li>
  <li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
  <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
  <li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</li>
  <li>Help and documentation</li>
</ol>

### Severity Ratings
<ol start="0">
  <li>No usability problem present</li>
  <li>Cosmetic problem only; lowest priority to fix</li>
  <li>Minor usability problem; low priority to fix</li>
  <li>Major usability problem; important to fix; top priority</li>
</ol>

## Website 1: [The Global Goals](https://www.globalgoals.org/goals/11-sustainable-cities-and-communities/)

![screenshot of global goals](globalgoals-1.png)

### Background Information

The Global Goals website was created by Project Everyone, a not-for-profit agency working together with various organizations in order to publicize information regarding the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. 

### Heuristic Evaluation

_Overall Evaluation_: The website is relatively simple to navigate, although some information is repeated across pages, which can be confusing. The lack of a search bar element makes it difficult to find specific elements on the website in an appropriate amount of time. There is an interesting focus on the aesthetic and branding of the Global Goals, which seems to be equated with news. It may take users a while to learn how to navigate the website and complete their tasks.  

| Heuristic & Description | Evaluation | Explanation | Severity Rating |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **1\. Visibility of system status**<br>The website presents information about its current status. | **Good**: The links in the navigation bar change background color on hover and have a small animation.<br>**Good**: All buttons on the page change color on hover. | The website consistently informs the user what page they are on and when they are hovering on a link. The user is always aware of the website’s current status. | 0 |
| **2\. Match between system and the real world**<br>The website uses familiar language and concepts that users can understand. | **Good**: The website provides icons for each of the targets to help users understand what they mean.<br>**Good**: In the menu to change languages, each language is displayed in their respective alphabet or writing system.<br>**Bad**: The “Resources” button links to logo and branding information rather than information on Sustainable Cities and Communities. | A possible solution would be to relocate the logo and branding information link to the bottom of the page and rename the link to “Brand Guidelines.” | 2 |
| **3\. User control and freedom**<br>The website allows users to easily undo their mistakes. | **Good**: On the “Resources” page, the website links to another page containing information on the 17 campaigns, in case they were looking for that instead of logo and branding information.<br>**Good**: The website opens “Share This Page” social media links in a small popup window so that users can easily close it if they clicked on the links by mistake. | The website provides methods for users to undo their mistakes, e.g. by redirecting them to the right page.| 0 |
| **4\. Consistency and standards**<br>The website follows platform and industry conventions. | **Good**: Clicking on “The Global Goals” at the top and bottom of the website links to the homepage.<br>**Good**: The website features a navigation bar with links to each of the main pages.<br>**Good**: The website contains quick access links to pages in the footer of the website. | The website follows industry conventions by having a navigation bar with a logo that links to the homepage, as well as a footer that contains more extensive links and other information. | 0 |
| **5\. Error prevention**<br>The website prevents users from making errors. | **Good**: When attempting to subscribe to the newsletter with an invalid email address, the website prevents the user from subscribing. | The website will not let the user subscribe to the newsletter without providing a valid email, which prevents users from making the mistake of inputting an invalid email. | 0 |
| **6\. Recognition rather than recall**<br>The website presents information that is easily accessible to help users navigate the design. | **Good**: Each button on the website has a text label that provides information on what clicking on the button does.<br>**Bad**: Some buttons link to elements on the same page, while other buttons link to different pages, and other buttons link to external websites. | A possible solution would be to explain to the user that external links go to separate websites. The buttons that link to elements on the same page could be removed to avoid confusion when navigating the website. | 2 |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br>The website offers a good experience to both novice and expert users. | **Good**: The website provides shortcuts to various links at the bottom of the page.<br>**Bad**: When changing the language of the website, the website redirects to the homepage rather than staying on the current page. | The website redirecting to the homepage when switching the language may be confusing to novice users. A possible solution would be to have the website remain on the current page when switching the language. It may also be a good idea to have a search bar element that allows users to search for elements that they cannot easily access.| 2 |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**<br>The website contains only necessary information and focuses on the essentials. | **Bad**: The website repeats information and includes the same information on different pages. For example, the “Things to Do” and “Take Action” buttons link to the same information on different pages. | A possible solution would be to reduce the amount of repetitive information by removing it. The “Things to Do” button and the element it links to could both be removed. | 1 |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**<br>The website provides error messages that are clear and useful. | **Good**: When attempting to subscribe to the newsletter with an invalid email address, the website provides an error message that tells the user what is wrong with the email address. | By providing an error message explaining what is wrong with the email address, the website allows users to correct their mistakes easily. | 0 |
| **10\. Help and documentation**<br>The website offers documentation to help users understand how to use the design if needed. | **Good**: The website provides a “Contact Us” page for users linked at the bottom of the website. | There is no need to have extra documentation for how to use this website, so a “Contact Us” page is sufficient. | 0 |

## Website 2: [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment)

![screenshot of world bank](worldbank-1.png)

### Background Information

The World Bank is a website created by the World Bank Group, which consists of five economic organizations. The goals of the World Bank Group are to “end extreme poverty within a shared generation and boost shared prosperity.” The website provides information on urban development as an international issue and what the World Bank is doing to achieve their goals by acting to improve that issue.

### Heuristic Evaluation

_Overall Evaluation_: The website contains an overwhelming amount of information, and it can be easy for first-time users to get lost when navigating the website. Some links are broken or outdated. The website provides plenty of shortcuts for experienced users to complete their tasks. However, novice users could easily be confused.

| Heuristic & Description | Evaluation | Explanation | Severity Rating |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **1\. Visibility of system status**<br>The website presents information about its current status. | **Good**: Each page link in the navigation bar includes a line underneath it when the user is on the respective page.<br>**Good**: Every link in the website is underlined on hover.<br>**Good**: Each tab features an arrow that indicates which tab the user is currently on.<br>**Bad**: The tab “COVID-19” is colored differently from the other tabs, even when the user is not on that tab. | A solution would be to color the “COVID-19” tab the same color as the other tabs to prevent confusion regarding which tab the user is currently on. | 1 |
| **2\. Match between system and the real world**<br>The website uses familiar language and concepts that users can understand. | **Good**: The website uses familiar phrases such as “Who We Are” and “What We Do” to help users understand what information pages link to.<br>**Bad**: The website uses ambiguous terms like “Context” and “Strategy” as labels for some elements | A solution would be to use more familiar terms or phrases for “Context” and “Strategy,” such as “About Our Mission” and “What’s Next.” | 1 |
| **3\. User control and freedom**<br>The website allows users to easily undo their mistakes. | **Bad**: Social media links do not open in a new tab, while links to articles on the website do. | If users click on social media links by mistake, they should be able to easily close the tab and return to their position on the previous page. A possible solution would be to have social media links open in a new tab. | 2 |
| **4\. Consistency and standards**<br>The website follows platform and industry conventions. | **Good**: The website has a header with a navigation bar and a footer with links to various pages on the website.<br>**Good**: The website logo at the top of the website links to the homepage. | The website follows industry conventions by having a header and footer with links that navigate to various pages on the website. | 0 |
| **5\. Error prevention**<br>The website prevents users from making errors. | **Good**: The website prevents users from subscribing to a newsletter until they fill all mandatory fields and provide a valid email address. | The website will not let the user subscribe to the newsletter without providing a valid email, which prevents users from making the mistake of inputting an invalid email. | 0 |
| **6\. Recognition rather than recall**<br>The website presents information that is easily accessible to help users navigate the design. | **Good**: Buttons and links have clear and specific text labels that help users understand their functions. | Users do not have to remember what each button or link does, because the labels clearly indicate their functions. For example, the links “Subscribe to our Sustainable Cities Newsletter” and “Follow our Sustainable Cities Blog” are clearly labeled. | 0 |
| **7\. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br>The website offers a good experience to both novice and expert users. | **Good**: Links on the navigation bar have drop-down menus to subpages for easy access.<br>**Good**: The website features a search bar element that allows experienced users to quickly access the information they want. | Experienced users can take shortcuts by using the drop-down menus and the search bar. Novice users can still find that information by clicking on the main pages in the navigation bar and exploring the website. | 0 |
| **8\. Aesthetic and minimalist design**<br>The website contains only necessary information and focuses on the essentials. | **Good**: The page on “Urban Development” contains links to articles with a headline, photo, and summary, while the bulk of the information is on a separate page that can be accessed when clicking the link.<br>**Bad**: Each of the elements on the “Urban Development” page look different when their contents are similar.<br>**Bad**: The website contains a lot of information on every page, which makes it difficult to navigate. | A possible solution would be to make the elements on the “Urban Development” page with similar contents also similar in appearance. This would help users navigate the page by making the page simpler and less busy. Spacing out elements or separating them on different pages might also help make the website appear less busy. | 3 |
| **9\. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**<br>The website provides error messages that are clear and useful. | **Good**: When users do not fulfill mandatory fields when subscribing to a newsletter, the website informs them that they must fill the field.
