# Assignment 02: Usability Testing
Helen Quach | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Introduction
[The Global Goals](https://www.globalgoals.org/) website

The Global Goals website raised some usability concerns during the heuristic evaluation. First, the design of the website had some links with labels that could potentially have confused users. Some buttons linked to elements on the same page, while other buttons linked to external websites. The lack of a search bar on the website also could have frustrated users who were looking for specific information.
