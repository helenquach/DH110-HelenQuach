# Assignment 02: Usability Testing
Helen Quach | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Introduction
[The Global Goals](https://www.globalgoals.org/) website was created by Project Everyone, a not-for-profit agency working together with various organizations in order to publicize information regarding the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals.

The Global Goals website raised some usability concerns during the heuristic evaluation. First, the design of the website had some links with labels that could potentially have confused users. Some buttons linked to elements on the same page, while other buttons linked to external websites. The lack of a search bar on the website also could have frustrated users who were looking for specific information. The purpose of the usability test is to understand the extent to which these concerns actually affect users, if at all. 

In Task 1, the user is asked to find a news article on the Global Goals website. The task is designed to evaluate the user's ability to look for specific information and the potential need for a search bar on the website. Next, Task 2 asks the user to investigate a specific campaign of The Global Goals. This task is designed to evaluate the clarity of the links' labels on the website and how easy it is to find information on The Global Goals' campaigns. Finally, in Task 3, the user is asked to navigate to the page about Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities and to find things one can do to improve their local community. This task evaluates the user's ability to access information about what people can do to help advance the specific sustainable development goal of Sustainable Cities and Communities.
