# Assignment 02: Usability Testing
Helen Quach | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Introduction
[The Global Goals](https://www.globalgoals.org/) website was created by Project Everyone, a not-for-profit agency working together with various organizations in order to publicize information regarding the United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals.

The Global Goals website raised some usability concerns during the heuristic evaluation. First, the design of the website had some links with labels that could potentially have confused users. Some buttons linked to elements on the same page, while other buttons linked to external websites. The lack of a search bar on the website also could have frustrated users who were looking for specific information. In order to understand the extent to which these concerns actually affected users, if at all, I wanted to conduct a usability test on this website.

In Task 1, the user is asked to find a news article on the Global Goals website. The task is designed to evaluate the user's ability to look for specific information and the potential need for a search bar on the website. Next, Task 2 asks the user to investigate a specific campaign of The Global Goals. This task is designed to evaluate the clarity of the links' labels on the website and how easy it is to find information on The Global Goals' campaigns. Finally, in Task 3, the user is asked to navigate to the page about Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities and to find things one can do to improve their local community. This task evaluates the user's ability to access information about what people can do to help advance the specific sustainable development goal of Sustainable Cities and Communities.

## Reflection
After conducting the pilot usability test, I learned several things about the Global Goals website as well as the usability test process.

First, the participant asked if there was a "search bar" on the website when performing Task 1. I believe that the lack of a search bar on the Global Goals website made it difficult and frustrating for users looking for specific information to find that information. When performing Task 2, the participant struggled to find the "Shortcuts" links at the bottom of the website, where the "Campaigns" page link is hidden. I think that users looking for information on the campaigns that the Global Goals is participating in will struggle to find the right information. The participant spent a lot of time on the "Podcast" page, while the "GLOBAL GOALCASTS" podcast is featured on its own page accessed from the "Campaigns" page.
