# Assignment 03: User Research
Helen Quach | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Project Description

### Design Challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
> My goal is to support users with a community where they can learn about environmental sustainability and find ways to contribute to their local community that are ethical and sustainable.


#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
> This activity satisfies the user's need for esteem. By offering a space where the user can learn about environmental sustainability, the user can gain self esteem by feeling like they are contributing to their community. It also aims to connect users with others who care about environmental sustainability, which offers the user a sense of social belonging.


#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> The current solution to find information about environmental sustainability is word of mouth through real-life interactions or social media posts. 


#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
> The limitations with real-life interactions and social media posts is that they are not curated. The user has to wait until a person wants to discuss environmental sustainability with them or a relevant post shows up on their social media feed. With this project, the information will be easily accessible to the user such that the user can access the information whenever they want.



### Target Users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
> Demographics: The target users are educated young adults who care about sustainability and the environment. Target users may be college students or recent graduates. Users live in a home or apartment.

> Preference: Users care about saving the environment and enjoy getting involved with their community. Users have strong motivation and feel like they can make a difference in the world.

> Expertise: Users require no expertise for this project.

> Mainstream vs. extreme: A mainstream user would be a person who is curious about getting started with living sustainably. An extreme user would be a person who is passionate about a sustainable lifestyle and an advocate for the environment.

#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
> Users would likely look for information about environmental sustainability and research methods to help their community while sitting down. This may occur at home, on public transportation, or elsewhere whenever users have the time and the space. Users may be curious about sustainability or actively looking for the next course of action.


#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
> Users may look for recommendations on how to help their community and live a sustainable lifestyle, look for news articles related to the environment, or seek to learn about environmental sustainability in general.


### Research Methods
The research method I chose was participatory interaction. I interviewed a participant and asked the participant to complete some tasks while I observed their actions. Then I asked the participant relevant questions and recorded their answers.

The activities the participant completed were: 
* Task 1: Looking for a local business they would be interested in supporting.
  * I wanted to know what an experienced user would look for in a local business. I also wanted to know what kinds of features a user would use when doing research.
* Task 2: Selecting an interesting news article, reading it, and sharing their thoughts.
  * I wanted to know what kinds of topics would draw an experienced user's attention. I also wanted to see if experienced users would be interested in reading relevant news articles.

### ⭐️ Insights from the interview
1️⃣ The user wants to feel reassured by others doing the same activities 
> "Sometimes it does feel that just me doing the sustainable activities that I’m doing myself, it doesn’t really feel like it makes a difference, because nobody else is doing it. But when I get my roommates or friends that I know to join me, it makes me feel like there’s a difference."

2️⃣ The user wants to be part of a community with like-minded people
> "Social media is a great thing for connecting with people and friends, but I would love to have a social media platform that’s geared towards sustainability and connecting with people that are sustainability-minded."

3️⃣ The user is interested in supporting local businesses who share their values
> "I do think I need to do a little more research on particular thrift stores, because I know someone mentioned to me the other day \[...\] that Salvation Army is very much anti-LGBTQ+, or at least when I last researched them, anti-LGBTQ+ was in their values. So that would be a company that I wouldn’t want to support."

4️⃣ The user wants relevant news articles to be easily accessible
> "I feel like a lot of the time, the idea of having to go on, like, Google, for example, and search through a bunch of articles just to find one that’s related to business and the energy transition, it’s something that doesn’t seem very viable to me to do all the time when I have other things I need to be doing."

5️⃣ The user is constantly looking for new ways to live a sustainable lifestyle
> "There’s always more things I could be doing, but I just have to research it and look what sustainable swaps I could be doing better that are achievable and tangible for me personally in the way I live my life."

## Reflection

The contextual inquiry process provided me with a lot of helpful insights about the target users and gave me a clearer direction to follow for my project. I struggled initially with developing the questions for the interview, but overall, I feel that the interview was very helpful. I found that the questions I asked the participant as follow-ups to their answers were more insightful than the questions I wrote initially. Listening to the participant and responding to the participant with the goal of learning about target users proved to be fruitful. I think that the activities I asked the users to complete were not detailed enough, because the user completed them very quickly. For the first task, I asked the user to do the task again with more guidance the second time, which was more informative than the first time the user completed the task. If I were to do something differently next time, I would begin the interview with a more specific goal and a better understanding of what I want to learn about the user. I want to appear more friendly and conversational rather than reading questions from a script.
