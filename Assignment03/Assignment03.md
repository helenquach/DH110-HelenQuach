# Assignment 03: User Research
Helen Quach | DH 110 | Fall 2022

## Project Description

### Design Challenge
#### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
> My goal is to support users with a community where they can learn about environmental sustainability and find ways to contribute to their local community that are ethical and sustainable.


#### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
> This activity satisfies the user's need for esteem. By offering a space where the user can learn about environmental sustainability, the user can gain self esteem by feeling like they are contributing to their community. It also aims to connect users with others who care about environmental sustainability, which offers the user a sense of social belonging.


#### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> The current solution to find information about environmental sustainability is word of mouth through real-life interactions or social media posts. 


#### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
> The limitations with real-life interactions and social media posts is that they are not curated. The user has to wait until a person wants to discuss environmental sustainability with them or a relevant post shows up on their social media feed. With this project, the information will be easily accessible to the user such that the user can access the information whenever they want.



### Target Users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
> Demographics: The target users are educated young adults who care about sustainability and the environment. Target users may be college students or recent graduates. Users live in a home or apartment.

> Preference: Users care about saving the environment and enjoy getting involved with their community. Users have strong motivation and feel like they can make a difference in the world.

> Expertise: Users require no expertise for this project.

> Mainstream vs. extreme: A mainstream user would be a person who is curious about getting started with living sustainably. An extreme user would be a person who is passionate about a sustainable lifestyle and an advocate for the environment.

#### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
> Users would likely look for information about environmental sustainability and research methods to help their community while sitting down. This may occur at home, on public transportation, or elsewhere whenever users have the time and the space. Users may be curious about sustainability or actively looking for the next course of action.


#### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?
> Users may look for recommendations on how to help their community and live a sustainable lifestyle, look for news articles related to the environment, or seek to learn about environmental sustainability in general.
