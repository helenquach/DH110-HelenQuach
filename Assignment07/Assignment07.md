## Project Description
The goal of this project is to design a website that provides people with the resources to learn about one of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, Goal #11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The website will feature a News page where users can easily access the latest relevant news regarding environmental sustainability. The website will also feature a social aspect on the Community page, where users can interact with one another in a forum and ask questions about living a sustainable lifestyle, read reviews of local businesses, and recommend tips for other members of the community. The website is called Greenforum (stylized "greenforum") to emphasize the intersection between community and sustainability.

### Purpose of interactive prototype
The purpose of creating this high-fidelity prototype is to visualize the tasks with the completed graphic design and validate the intuitivity of the interaction flow for the user.

### Process of design
The prototype was created using Figma. First, I started by digitizing my [low-fidelity wireframes](https://github.com/helenquach/DH110-HelenQuach/blob/main/Assignment05/Assignment05.md) and applying my [design system](https://github.com/helenquach/DH110-HelenQuach/tree/main/Assignment06). The tasks that I chose for this prototype were developed along with two user personas, which you can see [here](https://github.com/helenquach/DH110-HelenQuach/blob/main/Assignment04/Assignment04.md). After digitizing the wireframes, I started to implement the interactive elements by creating variations of interactive components for different states and adding functionality to the prototype. I added animations for some interactive elements and made sure to follow my design system throughout the design process. In the prototype design, I used some icons from the [Material Design Icons](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1014241558898418245) library by Google Fonts.

### Tasks
The high-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
1. The ability to read news articles and share them on social media
> In this task, the user navigates to the News page and looks for a news article. The user clicks on an interesting news article and reads it. Then the user shares the news article to their social media account by clicking on one of the social media logos in the sidebar.
2. The ability to read/write posts in a community forum, filter posts by tags, comment on posts, and reply to comments
> In this task, the user navigates to the Community page and looks for posts. The user filters the posts by the Question tag, so that only the posts tagged with Question are seen. The user clicks on the first post and reads it. Then the user posts a comment. Then the user replies to the first comment on the post. Then the user navigates back to the Community page. The user will then create a new post, uploading a photo and tagging it as Recommendation. The user will publish the post, which will bring them back to the Community page.

## Wireflows
### Task 1: News page - browsing news articles, reading an article, sharing the article to social media

### Task 2: Community forum - filtering posts by tag, reading a post, commenting on a post, replying to a comment, and creating a post

## Cognitive Walkthrough
I conducted a survey about the design of the prototype and received two responses.

### Summary of findings
* Adding a "Post successful" confirmation message after making a social media post would be helpful.
* Adding a filter for the news articles by topic or date would be useful.
* Adding social media icons to the footer will make the links more clear to the user.

## Usability Testing
I also asked a participant to complete both of the tasks implemented in the prototype.

Here is the link to the [transcript.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17RjgHGkcVaiiWQj12Cl1owuyfObbXb3R2pgJhNe0mQM/edit?usp=sharing)

### Summary of findings
* The participant completed both tasks sucessfully with very few issues.
* The participant took slightly longer than expected when completing the "Upload a photo" task, but I think this was due to the confusing state of the prototype and not the design itself. 
* The participant said that the tasks were "pretty straightforward" and the website was "well-organized."
* The participant appreciated how explicit the label "Share this page on social media" was.

Overall, I think that the cognitive walkthrough went well. The user completed both of the tasks relatively quickly, faster than I expected. I do not think there was anything that was not obvious or not intuitive. The one part where the participant struggled was during the "Upload a photo" part of Task 2. I think that this was because the photo was already present in the high-fidelity prototype, so the user was confused on how to proceed. If I could make an adjustment to the prototype, I would add more screens without the photo and make it so that the photo would appear only after the user "uploads" the photo. However, I do not think this is a flaw with the design of the website itself, only the prototype. During the survey, some areas in the prototype that could be improved were revealed. I received suggestions to add a confirmation after making a social media post and to add a filter for the news articles, which I think could be useful. In the future, I will make these changes.
